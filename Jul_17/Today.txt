i was able to fix yesterday's issues. 
i was able to see the list of book that the user borrowed. 

WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?

KeyError at GET /users/1
key :loan not found in: %Mylibrarynew.Accounts.User{...}

the root cause?
The User schema was correctly defined with: has_many :loans, Mylibrarynew.Library.Loan
- But somewhere in the code (template, view, or controller), i accessed the singular key :loan: @user.loan  # ❌ incorrect
- This raised a KeyError because the User struct does not have a :loan key — only a :loans key (plural), as defined in the schema.

HOW I SOLVE?

Update all references from: @user.loan  # ❌ TO @user.loans  # ✅
and loop through or access the correct list of associated loans.
then SOLVED!
