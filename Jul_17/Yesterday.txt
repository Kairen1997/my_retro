PROJECT FINANCIAL PLANNING ENGINE

Still in stage of planning. i did research on how the auto calculation works.

in order for the auto calculation works. this is the list of input required

- total cost = representing the total cost of umrah
- deposit_paid = booking confirmation and input to calculate the remaining balance
- depature_date = include in packages
- booking_date  = 
- Payment_frequency = how much to pay / month and how many month left

The balance payment need setteled before the depature date. 

flow

[User selects package] → 
[System shows package price + deposit] → 
[User pays deposit] → 
[System verifies] → 
[Installment plan auto-generated] → 
[Payment tracking begins]
