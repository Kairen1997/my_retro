(cons yesterday assignment)

i was able to complete the task with chatgpt asistance

today's assignment remind me of this command:

- mix phx.gen.schema SchemaName table_name field:type field:type ...
- mic ecto.migrate

used whenever we want to add any types of database 

for an example: 

mix phx.gen.schema Authentication.CredentialProfile credential_profiles \
full_name:string ic_number:string phone_number:string address:string \
birthdate:date credential_id:references:credentials



++++++++++++++++++++++
today assignment - Authentication workflows

User Registration -> email confirmation -> user login  -> session authentication -> token-based authentication -> Logout
-> forgot password/reset password -> acess control (auth plug)
