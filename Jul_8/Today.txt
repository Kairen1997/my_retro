Today's Self-Learning Summary – Phoenix LiveView & CRUD

*********************************

CORE CONCEPT I LEARNED:

A. CRUD  in PHOENIX 

- Create, Read, Update, Delete operations using Phoenix
- How each operation works through LiveView, interacting with the backend using Ecto and Repo.

B. LIVEVIEW AND LIVECOMPONENT:

- LiveView manages the page's real-time behavior.
- LiveComponent is a reusable module, often used for forms like inserting or editing data.
- When I click a button, LiveComponent handles it with handle_event, processes form data, and updates the database using context functions like Accounts.update_user/2

C. FORM RENDERING AND UPDATING

- I learned how the form is built using <.simple_form> and how assign_new(:form, ...) initializes the form with changesets.

D. UNDERSTANDING PHOENIX EVENT:

- phx-submit, phx-change, and handle_event/3 are how LiveView reacts to user actions
- I now understand what happens when submitting the form — either success or error handling (flash message or re-rendering errors)

E. Code Flow (Update Process):

- Frontend triggers form → backend handle_event("save", ...) → calls update_user() → if successful, flash message and redirect; if failed, return error changeset and re-render the form
