A. Pay attention on the small step, (save any changes before run the code)
B. Rushing without practicing
    - i always moving quickly on concepts, reading and copying code. i might need to experiment one by one.

C. missing fundamentals
    - somehow i easly forgot the fundamentals on every process and code to rushing in executing the result.
    - i need to do it slow and steady, and somehow pause to make sure i understand each process.

D. Debugging frustration
    - there are few error happened during learning process. this somehow demotivating especially when i am not able to fix them in times.at the same time to catch what been tought and the next assignment
    - These frustration causing me to fail catching with today's lesson
